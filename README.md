# AcademicRiskPredictor

This project aims to predict adverse outcomes in students based on psychosocial factors using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes various features such as family support, academic behavior, and social dynamics to assess and predict risks, helping to identify students who may require additional support.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide insights into student risk factors and predict potential negative outcomes that could affect their academic success. By leveraging psychosocial data, the model helps educators and administrators take proactive measures to support at-risk students.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the raw data into a usable format for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Clustering (K-Means)**: Use K-Means clustering to categorize students into different risk levels based on psychosocial factors.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Apply machine learning algorithms to predict student outcomes.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to communicate insights andn to interprete the evaluation metrics to stakeholders.

## Jupyter Notebook

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes the following:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning the dataset.
2. **Feature Encoding**: Encoding categorical variables and preparing the data for machine learning models.
3. **Clustering (K-Means)**: Using K-Means clustering to group students into different risk levels, helping to identify students who may need additional support.
4. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models to predict student outcomes.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance and comparing results.
6. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing key insights and findings, including the distribution of students across risk levels.
